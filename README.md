# Parameter_Reconstruction_Bloch_Torrey_Master_Thesis
Code implementations of algorithms developed in the master thesis "Reconstruction methodology for MRI based on the Bloch-Torrey equation".

The File Bloch_Torrey_Solver.py provides a numerical solver for the Bloch-Torrey equation in the rotating frame, where the solution is saved in a File
The functions $T_1$, $T_2$, $M^{eq}$ and $B$ are required to be symbolic expressions.
